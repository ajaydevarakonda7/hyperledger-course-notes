## Growing interest in hyperledger technologies
Advent of personal computers has caused a rise in server client architectures. 

Computing started with mainframes. Then cloud computing came along and cause distributed hardware resources but still \
application level centralization existed. Distributed systems like blockchain "give explicit control of digital assets \
to end-users and remove the need to trust any third-party servers and infrastructure" (copied from muneeb ali's post).

## DLT
Distribute ledger technologies = block chain technologies + smart contracts

DLTs existed even before bitcoin, but bitcoin =

convergence(
1. timestamping transactions, 
2. p2p networks, crypto,
3. shared computational power,
4. new algo
)
